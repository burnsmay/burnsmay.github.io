    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My name is Maye Burns and I am a student studying at Michigan State University. I am currently going into my third year majoring in Computer Science Engineering.
      Growing up in Northern Michigan, I went to a very small school; consequently, I wasn't exposed to many classes outside of primary ones.
      Generally, I was always more interested in the mathematics or science classes as opposed to subjects like english or history. In my senior year of high school, I did get the opportunity to take a computer programming my class, introducing me to the subject.
      Since then, I became more intrigued and curious about technology and what problems it can help resolve. While I do appreciate technology, I also have a strong passion for arts.
      The arts, including music, painting, theater, and photography, has always been an interest of mine. I hope to combine these interests of mine in a career one day.
